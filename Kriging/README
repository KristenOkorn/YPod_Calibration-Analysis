Note: This is a very basic first pass at kriging using the very limited resources available in MatLab. More advanced kriging for this project will likely be done in R â€“ stay tuned for a future repo with better analysis tools.


Kriging_attempt1.mat is the actual code to be run (generates heatmap style gif)
Krigingvariance.mat also generates a gif, but of the variance only (not the actual concentrations)

The other .mat files (kriging and variogram) are subfunctions that need to be in the same folder in order for the code to run

The example .gif is from kriging_attempt1

I gridded the image using separate software to map each of the pod locations to a more convenient location ex. (1,3) on this grid instead of the actual GPS coordinates
